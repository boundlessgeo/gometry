# Design
A review of some oft used geometry libraries and how they'll influence the design of this one

## Existing Libraries 
- Boost Geometry: https://github.com/boostorg/geometry
- Java Topology Suite: https://github.com/locationtech/jts
- Turf.js: https://github.com/Turfjs/turf
- Apache SIS: http://sis.apache.org/

## Design considerations and Desires
- "Easy things should be easy, hard things should be possible"
- Support for 3D
- Support for multiple projections 
- Easy and native IO 
- Easy and native spatial comparators
- Easy and native spatial operations
- New school focus:
-- GeoJSON, GeoPackage over GML/Shapefile
